#  Welcome to Dime
This app was created for assisting in the experience of buying items instore. This app asks for your location, and based on that location, will generate coupons in your area. 
As of now, I have no need for the location modal class given that contained a user's location because of my newfound knowledge of CLLocation. As for Google Maps API, I am not utilizing any feature of the app currently, so will be using MapView as Google Maps asks for some money. 

My data source is from the groupon API, but I am currently using a Sample API key. Groupon doesn't want to give the API key to individuals, but I have attempted to get around this by using my work at the Cal Poly Corporation to apply for that full key. In the case I cannot get a key, the sample works perfectly fine, but with some limited functionality. In the scope of this project, I believe it will not affect much, but would be more of a problem if I were to release the app to the appstore.
